# Facemash

For those that don't know, Facemash was [originally] a way for students at Harvard to match up random people and score who's hot and who's not (what a wholesome idea)

I, as you can see, decided to bring it back but for VCs on Twitter to figure out who's the hottest VC in the game (not by ROI but by looks of course)
